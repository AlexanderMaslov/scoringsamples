	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>This is a main area. Performance Samples grew from years of iterative private orchestral/choral sample development; an exploration of how session configuration and post-production processes can nurture musical nuance within sampling.The culmination: commercial libraries along the lines of what has worked in private development.The aim: expressive & energetic instruments unconfined by technical propriety. Heart and character in a decidedly function>form presentation. Clean samples, comprehensive patch lists, fancy GUIs, and other elements of tradition are not part of the picture here.The methodology: performance-sourced and non-standard techniques for enhanced expression and energy in the realm of creative notation, musician selection, performance styles, recording environment, post-pro processes, and programming.</p>
